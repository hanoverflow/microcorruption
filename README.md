# Microcorruption Tooling
This is a 2025 summer project from Jacob about "from scratch" binary analysis. Microcorruption has a bunch of interesting challenges on a relatively unique machine architecture. How hard will it be to pull the challenges off their web format, write an emulator / debugger, or create decompilation & static analysis tools? Follow along with this repository that will likely get 1 hour of work per week and not achieve these goals!

## Planned Structure
- Python based browser interop for pulling and submitting challenges
    - source can be found in site-driver
- Zig based emulator
    - does not exist yet
- unknown analysis tooling
- CLI
    - does not exist yet, will be written in zig

- Zig CLI
- Can list challenges and pull assembly from particular challenges
- Can also submit solutions to challenges
- Can emulate
- Can assemble / disassemble
- Can perform static / dynamic analysis?
